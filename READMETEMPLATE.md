# Atom App Icons
A project for custom [Atom](https://atom.io) Icons. All Rights Reserved with [Github](https://github.com) and the respective owners of the themes I am using.
Inspired from [vscode-icons](https://github.com/dhanishgajjar/vscode-icons), a similar project for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by [@dhanishgajjar](https://github.com/dhanishgajjar/)

    * Open the file in any text editor.
    * Change the required color values.
    * Send a PR with the new SVG file in `svg` folder, the Linux and Windows flavours will be generated by code.
* Different Design:
    * Use any software to make an SVG.
    * It would be better if you use the [icon.svg](icon.svg) as a base.
    * Keep the size `512x512px`
    * In the SVG code, remove the width & height attributes. (They create issues while resizing for Linux and Windows icons).
    * Keeping the `viewbox` at `0 0` is also recommended
    * Send a PR with the new SVG file in `svg` folder, the Linux and Windows flavours will be generated by code.

## How to Install

**Mac OS:**

Download [Image2Icon](http://www.img2icnsapp.com/) app. Drop the  `svg` as source and export a `ICNS` file.

Easiest way to change the icons is by using https://freemacsoft.net/liteicon/. Just Drag and Drop the custom icon and hit `Apply Changes`.

Copy the `.icns` file you'd like to use. Find VS Code in your Applications folder, right click the icon and select `Get Info`. Click the icon in the top right corner so that a blue highlight appears around it. `âŒ˜ + V` to paste the new icon in. It may take a few restarts of VS Code for the icon to take.

If for some reason that doesn't work, then dragging the `.icns` to the icon (in the top left) of the info pane, until you see the green plus sign and then dropping it works.

**Windows:**

Right click on the shortcut App Icon, select properties and then shortcut tab and then `change icon` button.

**Linux:**

I think this works, but not sure https://smdavis.us/projects/menulibre/
